### libpaging2 ###

## Purpose ##

This application generates a set of library paging lists for Multnomah Count Library (MCL) branches. While
it is configured for MCL, it could easily be configured for any other library utilizing the SirsiDynix
Symphony integrated library system.

The application has two purposes: 1) to provide simple, clear, paging lists for MCL branches, 2) to 
demonstrate the capabilities of the <a href="https://github.com/multnomah-county-it/libilsws" 
alt="LibILSWS GitHub Repository">LibILSWS</a> code library, which it utilizes to communicate with
the SirsiDynix system.
